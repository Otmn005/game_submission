# Resilience Run ‚Äî Uni Life (Australia)

A 2D dice-based board game that teaches and reinforces mental health & wellbeing strategies for Australian university students. Play through a short ‚Äúsemester,‚Äù make trade-offs, and finish with enough **Wellbeing** to succeed sustainably.

## Why this topic
Australian students face high psychological distress. Small, timely choices (counselling, pacing, hydration in heatwaves, budgeting, peer support) improve outcomes. The game connects those decisions to simple, memorable mechanics.
