Goal: Brainstorm game themes and unique UX features for a browser cyber-awareness simulator focusing on AU + VN contexts.
Prompts used:
- "Generate 20 realistic cybersecurity incidents that could happen to a small organisation in Australia or Vietnam. Keep descriptions short (1â€“2 sentences) and include a suggested learning objective and location tag (AU/VN/both)."
- "Suggest 10 micro-affirmation lines used as 'mood toasts' after each decision."
- "Design 6 short 'perk' descriptions that are plausible and balanced for gameplay."
